The following code is for an ESP32 microcontroller, and it controls five LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green, White, Blue) connected to different GPIO pins. The LEDs start blinking in a pattern when a button is pressed. The blinking pattern can be toggled between LSB-to-MSB (left to right) and MSB-to-LSB (right to left) based on button presses. The current LED that is on is printed to the Serial Monitor.
